# Tennis-Pred

Tennis-Pred is a Python project designed to explore data science and machine learning techniques by predicting tennis match outcomes. The focus of this project is learning, experimentation, and practicing skills with real sports data not production-ready betting.

## Overview

In this project, I used historical tennis match data to:

- Predict match winners using XGBoost.

- Identify value bets based on model predictions.

- Simulate a bankroll and ROI over time.

This project served as a hands-on way to practice Python, pandas, machine learning, and data visualization. So the code isnt pretty and probably violates best practices.


## Key Learnings

- Data manipulation: Cleaning, merging, and feature engineering with pandas.

- Machine learning: Training and evaluating XGBoost models for classification.

- Model calibration: Calibrating trained model to perform better.

- Evaluation & insight: Comparing model predictions with bookmaker odds and exploring potential value bets.

- Simulation: Tracking bankroll performance and ROI over multiple bets.


## Further improvemets

- More realistic backtesting and tieing it to live odds
